  Abstract                 = {Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model--requiring prior physical access--has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.},

Today's high-end vehicles may have more than 4 kilometers of wiring, compared to 45 meters in vehicles manufactured in 1955. Reducing wiring mass through in-vehicle networks will bring an explosion of new functionality and innovation. Our vehicles will become more like PCs, creating the potential for a host of plug-and-play devices. On average, US commuters spend 9 percent of their day in an automobile. Thus, introducing multimedia and telematics to vehicles will increase productivity and provide entertainment for millions. Further, X-by-wire solutions will make computer diagnostics a standard part of mechanics' work and may even create an electronic chauffeur},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time Linux variants are becoming prominent solutions for the development of embedded systems. Compared to traditional real-time operating systems, embedded system engineers can leverage solutions and knowhow from the Linux development community (e.g., development tools, applications, drivers). Due to the availability of implementations of Internet protocols and network drivers, Linux also facilitates the implementation of embedded systems connected to the Internet. The goal of this paper is to evaluate experimentally the capabilities of the Real-time Linux variant RTAI/LXRT with respect to partitioning between different application software modules. Partitioning ensures that a failure caused by a design fault in one application software module cannot propagate to cause a failure in other application software modules, e.g., by blocking access to the CPU or by overwriting memory. Partitioning is important when building mixed-criticality systems comprising both non safety-critical software modules and safety-related ones. Even at the same level of criticality, partitioning improves the robustness of an embedded system. The experimental results described in this paper point out several limitations of RTAI/LXRT Linux concerning fault isolation. Based on these results, we propose modifications to improve the partitioning with respect to temporal and spatial interference.},

These systems however bear some limitations such as high cost, high false-alarm rate, and easy to be disabled. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a Sensor-network-based Vehicle Anti-Theft System (SVATS) to address these limitations. In this system, the sensors in the vehicles that are parked within the same parking area first form a sensor network, then monitor and identify possible vehicle thefts by detecting unauthorized vehicle movement. When an unauthorized movement is detected, an alert will be reported to a base station in the parking area, which sends warning messages to the security office. This paper focuses on the technical issues specific to the system such as topology management, theft detection, and intra-vehicle networking.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a taxonomy of replay attacks on cryptographic protocols in terms of message origin and destination. The taxonomy is independent of any method used to analyze or prevent such attacks. It is also complete in the sense that any replay attack is composed entirely of elements classified by the taxonomy. The classification of attacks is illustrated using both new and previously known attacks on protocols. The taxonomy is also used to discuss the appropriateness of particular countermeasures and protocol analysis methods to particular kinds of replays},
